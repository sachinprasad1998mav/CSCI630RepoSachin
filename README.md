# SDM-Spring2023 Open Source Maintenance Portfolio
This is my Online portfolio where I have documented my contributions to the open source project PantryNode.

# Highlights
 1)Creating a Forgot Password Interface
- [Initial issue created](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/136)
- [Updated Issue after change in the file structure of Pantry Node](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/197)
- [Initial Commits](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/blob/ForgotPassword/PantryNodeReact/src/pages/new_password.tsx)
- [Commits reflected after change in file structure](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/commit/e3258c285d12392c35856f52260ba5d72cfd1bfc)
- Worked with Devang Raval for approximately 6-7 weeks to create a front-end interface for users who forget their password. 
- Our collective effort is exhibited in the ForgotPassword branch and got approved for the created pull request and got merged to main branch.
- This contribution enhances the product by providing a secure way for users to recover their accounts, improving user experience.
- Some of my links are to initial commits, after some time, the folder structre of the Pantry Node changed completely. So my partner (Devang Raval) used the same committed code with some changes in new files, which are in the updated commit links.
- Adding a Redirection Feature :  After the creation of the PR for the Forgot Password Interface, I found a bug and resolved it by adding a feature to redirect the user to the login page after they reset  their password.
- This addition to the product streamlines user flow, allowing users to conveniently log in immediately after resetting their passwords.

 2) Testing Summary.js frontend
 I tried testing the Summary.js feature but it was almost the end of the semester, so I could not complete it, but i have created a branch called [testSummaryPage](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/tree/testSummaryPage/frontend/src/__tests__), but will be trying to complete it soon.
