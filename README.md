# SDM-Spring2023 Open Source Maintenance Portfolio
This is my Online portfolio where I have documented my contributions to the open source project PantryNode.

# Highlights
# 1)Creating a Forgot Password Interface
Worked with Devang Raval for 6 weeks to create a front-end interface for users who forget their password. Our collective effort is exhibited in the ForgotPassword branch.
This contribution enhances the product by providing a secure way for users to recover their accounts, improving user experience and security.

# 2)Adding a Redirection Feature
After the creation of the PR for the Forgot Password Interface, I added a feature to redirect the user to the login page after they reset their password.
This addition to the product streamlines user flow, allowing users to conveniently log in immediately after resetting their passwords.

# 3)Code Review for Security Update
I reviewed and provided feedback on a pull request for a security update. My role was to ensure the update didn't introduce any new issues and complied with the project standards.
My feedback helped maintain the high quality of the codebase and ensured that the update didn't introduce any vulnerabilities.
