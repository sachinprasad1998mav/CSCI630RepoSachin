+ Worked with Devang Raval for approximately 6-7 weeks to create a front-end interface for users who forget their password. 
+ Our collective effort is exhibited in the ForgotPassword branch and got approved for the created pull request and got merged to main branch.
+ This contribution enhances the product by providing a secure way for users to recover their accounts, improving user experience and security.
